### Tiny service with Klaytn features
Make a small application that includes at least 3 Klaytn features. You can choose 3 items in followings
```
- Role-based account
- Multisig account
- Fee delegation
- ValueTransferWithMemo transaction
- web3klaytn
```

_It would be great to make a console application when you use the web3j-ext or web3py-ext and UI/UX is not scored_
